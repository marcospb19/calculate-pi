/**
 * Little crazy project.
 *
 * Explanation if pending on each function, as I don't know if anyone
 * is going to read this, I'm not wasting my time, otherwise, leave an
 * issue on GitHub asking for it and I'll be happy to do it :D.
 *
 * So... really... don't expect to understand the function
 *     void optimized_64bit_linear_half_quadrant_method()
 *
 * After 8 months of programming, in 2018, I saw this video about PI
 *     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNnf_7e92Q
 *
 * Where Daniel Shiffman applies the Monte Carlo method to calculate PI,
 * but it's not meant to be accurate neither deterministic, it's just random.
 *
 * My approach addapt the formula (circle inside of square) using matrices
 * with fixed sizes to calculate PI. This method isn't as near as efficient
 * as any of the others well-known and famous ones, but I find it very
 * interesting that I could make this work and calculate some digits of PI
 * using a given formula, and several incredible optimizations.
 *
 * EDIT: OMG there's also this optimization while calculating consecutive
 * quadratic numbers that I discovered in highschool, oh man, it really
 * feels great to use that little snippet of childhood (teenager me?)
 * for something today (I mean, actually, it has only been 4 years HMMM).
 * I don't know, this was not meant to be an optimization (I wasn't even
 * into programming) but instead just a trick to be faster on exams and
 * also teach people how quadratic equations growth are predictably related
 * to odd numbers. (this optimization decreased from 8.5s to 5.3s)
 *
 * Maybe I'm getting crazy or something? xD
