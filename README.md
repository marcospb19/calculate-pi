# calculate-pi

A method I invented to calculate PI, little fun project.

Taking this assumption from Daniel Shiffman, initial formula was gave by
Daniel Shiffman, and then I explored this idea further.

IDK, is someone reading this?

To compile it:
```sh
gcc -O2 -lm -Wall pi.c -o pi
```

You can also use clang instead of gcc
